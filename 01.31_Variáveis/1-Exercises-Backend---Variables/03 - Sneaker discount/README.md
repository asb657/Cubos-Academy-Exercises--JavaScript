# Exercise 03

## Sneaker discount

You want to buy a new sneaker, however, you have the money for the month and you will only have R$ 80.00 left to buy it.

The sneakers cost R$ 129.99 but a friend of yours works at the store and can give you a discount coupon, the only thing he needs is to know how much percent discount you need.

Create a program to calculate the required percentage discount for you to be able to buy the shoe, using the rule of three.


#### Rule of three

Given 3 numbers, a, b and c, calculate d using the rule of three.

|  a  |  b  |
| :-: | :-: |
|  c  |  d  |

#### Example

| 27  | 123 |
| :-: | :-: |
| 50  |  d  |

![50 * 123 = 27d \ \frac{6150}{27} = d \ d â‰… 228](https://i.imgur.com/Mzjtbyq.png)
