# Exercise 06

## Average speed

Suppose you are working on developing a smart watch app that calculates the average speed of a person who is using the device while running.

Calculate the average speed of this person from the distance traveled by the person and the time elapsed, using the formula below.

However, the distance information you receive is in meters and the time is in seconds. That is, when applying this formula, the speed will be in meters per second. Ideally, your user should see the speed in km/h.

To do this, after calculating the speed, you must convert the unit from meters per second to km/h. To do this, simply multiply the result by 3.6.
