# Exercise 02

## Fahrenheit x Celsius

To convert degrees in Fahrenheit to degrees in Celsius we use the following formula:

![C = (F - 32) * \frac{5}{9}](https://useruploads.socratic.org/7RBgDMmiSFGaF4m6wUFK_37.4-celsius-to-fahrenheit-convert.jpgg)

Where,

F: degree in Fahrenheit
C: degree in Celsius

#### Example:

According to the weather app, it is now 73ºF in your city, if we converted that to Celsius, what would the result be?

Being:

F = 73

![C = (73 - 32) * \frac{5}{9} \ C = 41 * \frac{5}{9} \ C ≅ 23](https://i.imgur.com/ZP8YxZc.png)

Your program should print degrees in Celsius based on the input received.
