# Exercise 05

## Calculate the distance between two points

Calculate the distance between two points using the following formula, assuming that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on a plane:

![d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}](https://i.imgur.com/EIXmgc9.png)

Your program should print the result on the screen **d**

#### Examples:

| x1  | x2  | y1  | y2  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  4  |

![d = \sqrt{(1 - 1)^2 + (4 - 1)^2} \ d = \sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2} \ d = \sqrt{9} \ d = 3](https://i.imgur.com/vbKcS7g.png)
