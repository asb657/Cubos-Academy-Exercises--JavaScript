Exercise 07

## Cases of COVID-19

Suppose you are working at the Ministry of Health and you are working on a COVID-19 case simulator. Your job is to make a program that calculates the total number of infected people from 3 variables.

Po = the initial population of infected people
X = number of people to which an infected patient can transmit
t = time elapsed

That is, if:

Po = 1000
x = 4
t = 100

Your system will calculate how many people will be infected after 100 days, given that initially there were 1000 infected people, each of them transmitting to 4 other people.

For this, the formula is as follows:

![P = Po * x ^\frac{t}{7}](https://i.imgur.com/xT7rwGh.png)

P will be the number of infected people after time t has elapsed.
