# Exercise 04

## Calculating compound interest

To calculate compound interest, use the expression:

![A = P(1 + r)^t](https://i.imgur.com/4WcuNyx.png)

which,

A: amount
P: principal
r: interest rate
t: time

#### Example:

If a capital of R$1000 is invested for 5 months in the compound interest system at a fixed monthly rate of 12.5%, what will be the value of the amount?


C = 1000
R = 0,125
t = 5

![M = 1000 (1 + 0,125)^5 \ M = 1000 (1,802) \ M = 1802](https://i.imgur.com/lai9CG0.png)

Your program should print the amount based on the input received.
