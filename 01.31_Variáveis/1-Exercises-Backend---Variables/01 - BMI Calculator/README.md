## BMI Calculator

To calculate someone's BMI, we can use the following formula:

![I = \frac{P}{A²}](https://openaccesspub.org/article/926/images/image1.jpg)

Where,

Q: person's weight
A: person height
I: BMI

#### Example:

If my height is 1.79m and my weight is 76kg, what is my BMI?

Being:

P = 76
A = 1.79

![I = \frac{76}{1.79²} \ I = 23,7](https://i.imgur.com/U05asiT.png)

Your program should print someone's BMI based on the input received.
