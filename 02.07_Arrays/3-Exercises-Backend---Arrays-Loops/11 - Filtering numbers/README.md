# Exercise 11

## Filtering numbers

Declare an array containing any numbers.

Then create a new array that contains only the numbers of the original array that are between 10 and 20 or that are greater than 100. At the end, print the variable that stores the new array.

Example:

For the **original** array below:

```javascript=
original const = [5, 7, 13, 17, 26, 34, 118, 245];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
[13, 17, 118, 245]
```

Also test by changing the numbers of the original array! =)
