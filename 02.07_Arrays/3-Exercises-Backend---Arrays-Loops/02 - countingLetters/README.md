Exercise 02

## Counting letters

Declare a new variable that contains an array containing some letters.

Make a program that counts how many letters "E" or "e" are in that word.

Print cute messages to show the result, please. Even when no letter is found.

Examples:

**a)** When there is no letter "E" or "e" as in the **letters** array

```javascript=
const letters = ["A", "a", "B", "C", "L", "z"];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
No letter "E" or "e" was found.
```

**b)** When the letters "E" or "e" are found in the **letters** array

```javascript=
const letters = ["A", "e", "B", "C", "E", "z"];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
Found 2 letters "E" or "e".
```
