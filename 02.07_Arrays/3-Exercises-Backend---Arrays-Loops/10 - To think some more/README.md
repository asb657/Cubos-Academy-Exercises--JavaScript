# Exercise 10

## To think some more

Declare an array with any integers.

Then write a program that calculates the largest difference between two numbers in this array.

Example:

For the **numbers** array below:

```javascript=
const numbers = [8, 11, 4, 1];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
10
```

(since the biggest difference is 11 - 1 = 10)

Also test by changing the numbers. =)
