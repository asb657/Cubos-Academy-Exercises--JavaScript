# Exercise 05

## Filtering only the even numbers

Declare an array with any integers.

Then create a new array that contains only the even numbers from the original array.

At the end, print the array variable in the console.

Example:

For the **original** array below

```javascript=
original const = [1, 4, 12, 21, 53, 88, 112];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
[4, 12, 88, 112]
```

Test by varying the numbers from the original array too! =)
