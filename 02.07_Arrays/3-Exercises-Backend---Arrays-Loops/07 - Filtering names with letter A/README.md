# Exercise 07

## Filtering names with letter A

Declare an array with any names.

Then create a new array from the first that contains only the names starting with the letter "A" or "a" (upper or lowercase).
At the end, print the variable that stores the array.

Example

To the **names** array below

```javascript=
const names = ["Ana", "Joana", "Carlos", "amanda"];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
["Anna", "Amanda"]
```

Also test by varying the names and including other names that start with "A" or "a". =)

Test by varying the numbers from the original array too! =)
