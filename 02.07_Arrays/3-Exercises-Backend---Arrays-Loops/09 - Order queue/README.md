## Order queue

A food delivery company is struggling to organize the order of orders and needs to create a routine that organizes its orders in a queue in order of priority.

Knowing that the queue is currently in the following order:

```javascript=
constOrderQueue = ["order 12", "order 13", "order 14"];

// your code here

```

**a)** Add a new order `"order 15"` to the end of the queue.

**b)** Remove the first order `"order 12"` from the queue.

**c)** Print the queueDePedidos in the console

At the end, it should be printed in the console:

```
["order 13", "order 14", "order 15"];
```
