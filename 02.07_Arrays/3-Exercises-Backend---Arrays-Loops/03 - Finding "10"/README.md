# Exercise 03

## Finding "10"

Create an array of integers.

Write a program that checks if the number 10 exists in this array. If it exists, it informs the position (index) where the number 10 is. If it does not exist, it must be printed -1.

Examples:

**a)** For the **numbers** array below

```javascript=
const numbers = [54, 22, 14, 87, 284];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
-1
```

**b)** For the **numbers** array below

```javascript=
const numbers = [54, 22, 14, 10, 284];
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
3
```
