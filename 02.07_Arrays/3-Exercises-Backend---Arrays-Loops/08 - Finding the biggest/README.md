# Exercise 08

## Finding the biggest

Declare an array with any numbers.

Then write a program that finds the largest number in this array and prints it to the console.

Example:

For the **numbers** array below

```javascript=
const numbers = [3, 4, 1, 8, 11, 7, 5];

// your code here
```

You should print to the console:

```
11
```

Also test by changing the numbers! =)
