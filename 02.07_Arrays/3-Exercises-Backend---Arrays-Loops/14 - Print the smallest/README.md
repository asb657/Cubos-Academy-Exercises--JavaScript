# Exercise 14

## Print the smallest

Considering that we have two arrays of the same size (same number of items) and that all items in both arrays are numbers, we must, for each position, print the smallest value found between the two arrays.
Both arrays will have 5 items.

So for the following two arrays:

```javascript=
const arrayA = [5, 32, 3, 44, 1];
const arrayB = [57, 4, 21, 2, 13];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
5
4
3
2
1
```
