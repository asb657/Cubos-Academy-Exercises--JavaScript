# Exercise 13

## Checking circuit breakers

We need to check in a circuit breaker box which ones are on.
Assuming that the breaker box is represented by an array where each item in the array is a breaker, the item index being the breaker ID (starting at 0) and the item value a boolean indicating whether the breaker is on or not , print on the console only the circuit breakers that are on.
If possible, use the concept of truthiness.

Example:
Having the following array of 8 circuit breakers:

```javascript=
const breakers = [false, false, true, false, false, true, false, false];

// your code here
```
