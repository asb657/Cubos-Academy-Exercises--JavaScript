# Exercise 06

## Sum of even numbers

Declare an array with any integers.

Then, loop through this array and calculate the sum of the even numbers present in that array.

Example:

For the **numbers** array below

```javascript=
const numbers = [3, 4, 7, 8, 1, 6, 5, 10];

// your code here
```

It should be printed in the console:

```
28
```

Test by varying the numbers in the **numbers** array too! =)
