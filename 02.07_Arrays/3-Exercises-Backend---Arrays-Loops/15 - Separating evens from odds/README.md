# Exercise 15

## Separating evens from odds

In this exercise we will read an array of numbers to separate the evens from the odds. For this, we will check the original array item by item and if it is even, we will add the number in an even array, and if it is odd, we will add it in an odd array.

In the end, we must first print the array of evens, and then print the array of odd numbers (Note: it is not necessary to print the arrays item by item, it can be the entire arrays).

So for the example arrays below

```javascript=
original const = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const pairs = [];
const odd = [];

// your code here
```

We should print to the console

```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

**PLUS:** Try to solve the exercise using the 3 types of loop learned in class, one at a time.
