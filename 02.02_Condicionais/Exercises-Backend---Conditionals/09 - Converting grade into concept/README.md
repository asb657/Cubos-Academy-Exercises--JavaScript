# Exercise 09

## Converting grade into concept

A school is undergoing a migration of grades (ranging from 0 to 10) to concepts (ranging from A to E).

In order not to lose the history of old students and keep it consistent with the new conceptual way of evaluating, you must create a program that transforms a grade into a concept, according to the following table:

| Note | Concept |
| --- | --- |
| 9 to 10 | A |
| 8 to 8.9 | B |
| 6 to 7.9 | C |
| 4 to 5.9 | D |
| less than 4 | E |r
