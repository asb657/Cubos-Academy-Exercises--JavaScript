## Display name

A person can have a first name, last name and/or nickname.
Write a code that prints in the console only the nickname (if the nickname is filled in), or first name + last name (if the last name is filled in), or just the first name (which in our program is mandatory and must always be filled in).

**Important:** In this exercise, we should not use any comparison, equality or identity operators. For this exercise we will only use the concept of **truthiness**.

Also test for other use cases, such as when the nickname is filled in, which only the nickname should be printed, and also test when the last name is filled in that it should print in the console first name + last name.
