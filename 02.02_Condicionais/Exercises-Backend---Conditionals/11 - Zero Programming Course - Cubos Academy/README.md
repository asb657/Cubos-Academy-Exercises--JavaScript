# Exercise 11

## Zero Programming Course - Cubos Academy

At Cubos Academy, some students can take the Zero Programming Course and only start paying after completing the course when (and if) they have earned income above R$ 2,000.00. In this case, the amount of the installment to be paid is 18% of the monthly income of the staff.

After 60 months, regardless of having paid or not the total amount of the course (of R$ 18,000.00) the person does not owe anything, that is, the amount of the installment is zero.

**a)** Make a program that calculates the amount of the installment to be paid by the student. Print a beautiful message on the screen, with the value in reais.

**b)** Change your previous program so that when the installment amount to be paid is 0, the message explains why the student does not have to pay anything that month.

Test your program for other inputs. For each different situation the message must be adequate.
