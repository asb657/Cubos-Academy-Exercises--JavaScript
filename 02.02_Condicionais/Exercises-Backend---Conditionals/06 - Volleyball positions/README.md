# Exercise 06

## Defining the positions

After passing the first phase of a volleyball selection, successful candidates are separated into different groups, according to their height, to be tested for specific positions. Write a program that, given the height of a given candidate, tells which position he should test for.

If the player is less than 180cm, the program must print **FAIL**
If you are between 180cm and 185cm, the program should print **LIBERO**
If you are between 186cm and 195cm, the program should print **HITTER SPIKER**
If it is between 196cm and 205cm, the program should print **OPPOSTO SPIKER**
If it is longer than 205cm, the program should print **MIDDLE-BLOCKER**
