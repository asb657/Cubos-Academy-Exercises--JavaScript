# Exercise 04

## Naming the stones

Modify the previous code so that when the stone is a bushing, we say what the "name" of the doublet. For those who don't play dominoes, here's a glossary (according to portuguese vocabulary):

| Bucha de | Nome   |
| -------- | ------ |
| 0        | Branco |
| 1        | √Ås     |
| 2        | Duque  |
| 3        | Terno  |
| 4        | Quadra |
| 5        | Quina  |
| 6        | Sena   |
