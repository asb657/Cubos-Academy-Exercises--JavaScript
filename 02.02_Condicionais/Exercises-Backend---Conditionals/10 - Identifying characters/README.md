# Exercise 10

## Identifying characters

Make a program that identifies characters. Your program should classify this single character, which will be stored in a variable, in one of the categories below:

| Category | character |
| --- | --- |
| Vowel | A E I O U a e i o u|
| consonant | Any letter that is not a vowel |
| Number | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 0 |

Your program should tell you what category the character is. If the category is `Vowel`, your program must also inform if the vowel is uppercase or lowercase.
