# Exercise 12

## Day of the week

**a)** Knowing that the week has 7 days, being 1 for Monday and 7 for Sunday, make a program that checks the number stored in a variable and prints the day (in full) of the corresponding week.

For the example above, the program should print the message:

`Wednesday`

Commit the program.

**b)** Create a standard check if the number entered is not in the range 1 to 7.

For the example above, the program should print the message:

`The day of the week entered is not valid.`

Test your program for other inputs
