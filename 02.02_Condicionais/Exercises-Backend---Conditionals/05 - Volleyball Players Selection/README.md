# Exercise 05

## Volleyball Players Selection

In a selection process for new volleyball players, in some clubs, the first filter is to see if a given candidate has the minimum height required of 180cm. Make a program that, given the height of a given candidate, tells you if he or she passes or fails this first phase of the process.
