# Exercise 13

## Discount / Juninho`s Store

Juninho's Store has a super promotion. And when you buy any product you get a discount according to the payment method following the following table.

| Payment Method | Discount |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| credit | 5% |
| check | 3% |
| debt or cash | 10% |

**a)** Make a program that checks the type of discount, calculates the value of the product with the discount and prints the result.

Remember to take care that the monetary value always has two decimal places, only.

For the example above, the program should print the message:

`Amount to be paid: R$123.50`
