# Exercise 07

## Tax-free

According to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office, some people are exempt from paying income tax. We simplify here who these people are:

People with a serious illness
People who are already retired
If the person is not exempt, their taxable income is evaluated throughout the year. If this total income exceeds BRL 28,559.70, the person must pay income tax, otherwise, no.

Make a program that determines whether the person should pay IR or not.

* If the person does not have to pay IR for belonging to the group of exempt people, print on the screen **EXEMPTED PERSON**
* If the Passoa does not have to pay IR because it does not have the necessary minimum income, print it on the screen **NARROWLY ESCAPED**
* If the person must get IR print it on the screen **SO SORRY**
