## Finding Carlos in the crowd

1. Below we have a list of people and this list represents the participants of a party. `Carlos` has lost his friends and your task is to find him. The place where Carlos is is represented by the position of the object that contains his name in the list. When you find Carlos, if he is in position `123`, you should print `Folks... Carlos is in 123th position, go there!`.

```javascript
const participants = [
     { name: "John" },
     { name: "Anna" },
     { name: "Beatrix" },
     { name: "Mary" },
     { name: "Anna Clara" },
     { name: "Joan" },
     { name: "August" },
     { name: "Renan" },
     { name: "Patricia" },
     { name: "Carlos" },
     { name: "Renate" },
     { name: "Joseph" },
     { name: "Robert" },
     { name: "Sarah" },
     { name: "Junior" },
     { name: "Peter" },
