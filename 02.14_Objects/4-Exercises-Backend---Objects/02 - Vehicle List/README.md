# Exercise 02

## Vehicle list

1. Create a list of objects with the following properties and store it in a variable/constant called `cars`. Each property of an object must be assigned an appropriate value.

     - brand
     - model
     - year
     - color
     - quantity_doors
     - automatic

     Note: the `automatic` property must receive a boolean value that will indicate whether the car is automatic or not.

     _The information of the values of each property, of each object can be of your preference. Create at least 3 items in the list_
