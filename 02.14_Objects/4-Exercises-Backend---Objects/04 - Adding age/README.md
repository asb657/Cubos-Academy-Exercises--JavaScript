# Exercise 04

## Adding age

1. Given the list of objects below, add a new property called `of_age` for each object in the list. The property must receive a boolean value according to the `age` property of each object. If the age is greater than 17, the value must be `true`, otherwise `false`.

```javascript
const users = [
     {
         name: "John",
         age: 25,
     },
     {
         name: "Anna",
         age: 18,
     },
     {
         name: "Beatrix",
         age: 15,
     },
     {
         name: "Carlos",
         age: 16,
     },
     {
         name: "Antonio",
         age: 32,
     },
]
```

Test with other examples.

Commit the result.
