# Exercise 01

## User registration

1. Create an object with the following properties and store it in a variable/constant called `address`. Each property must be given an appropriate value.

     - street
     - number
     - complement
     - district
     - Zip code
     - City
     - state
     - country

2. Create an object with the following properties and store it in a variable/constant called `user`. Each property must be given an appropriate value.

     - name
     - email
     - telephone
     - birth date
     - address

     Note: the `address` property of the `user` object must receive, as a value, the `address` variable created previously.

_The information of the values of each property of the object can be of your preference_

Test with other examples.

Commit the result.
