# Exercise 06

## Separating youth from adult

1. Given the list of users below, separate users who are under 18 from the rest. For that, you must create two new constants `young` and `adult`. All users under 18 must be entered in the `youth` constant and the rest in the `adults` constant.

```javascript
const users = [
     {
         name: "John",
         age: 25,
     },
     {
         name: "Anna",
         age: 18,
     },
     {
         name: "Beatrix",
         age: 15,
     },
     {
         name: "Carlos",
         age: 16,
     },
     {
         name: "Antonio",
         age: 32,
     },
]
