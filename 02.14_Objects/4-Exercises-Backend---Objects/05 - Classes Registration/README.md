## Classes Registration

1. A new course has been created and its classes need to be registered. Below we have the `course` object, which has a property called `classes`. Your task is to add the list of classes below to the `classes` property of the `course` object.

```javascript
const course = {
     id: 1234,
     name: "Programming logic",
     classes: [],
}
```
