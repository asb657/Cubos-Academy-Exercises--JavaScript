```javascript
const book = {

    chapters: [
        {
            name: "The Habit Loop",
        },
        {
            name: "The Anxious Brain",
        },
        {
            name: "The Golden Rule of Habit Change",
        },
        {
            name: "Keystone Habits, or the Ballad of Paul O`neill",
        },
        {
            name: "Starbucks and the Habit of Success",
        },
        {
            name: "The power of a crisis",
        },
        {
            name: "How target knows what you want before you do",
